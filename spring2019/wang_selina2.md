* I chose this class because it combines both psychology and computer science. I want to learn how to code because it is a useful skill to have.

* Everything about programming and executing a research project scares me because I am new to coding.

* Can you go over on how to use piazza, what makes a good proposal, and a scientific writeup.

* What stories do you want to tell?
