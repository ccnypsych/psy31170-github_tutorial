* I chose this class because it combines both psychology and computer science. I want to learn how to code because it is a useful skill to have.

* Programming and executing a research project scares me because I am new to coding.

* Can you go over on how to use piazza, what makes a good proposal, and a scientific writeup.

* My cousin majored in computer science and told me to try out coding. I became more interested in learning to code when my psychology professor told me that it would be a useful skill to have in the psychology field.
